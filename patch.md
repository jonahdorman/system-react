## Release 0.8.16

**Bugfixes**
* REVERT [Change inline edit for accessibility](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react/pull/1332). It will not be updated. There is a new View/Edit Record Input pattern that uses the [Docked Former Footer component](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/docked-form-footer/) and this should be used instead of the Inline Edit Input in the future.

**Minor features**
* `dropdown` prop added to `DataTableRowActions` to increase customization of the dropdown menu
* `tabIndex` added to `MenuDropdown` component
* `Picklist` has been removed from examples. Please use a Comboboxe instead.
