  This is a community-driven project, and we can't do it without your participation. Please check out our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/salesforce/design-system-react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and review the Contributor Checklist if you haven't already, to make sure everything is squared away. TravisCI will take about 10 minutes to run through the same items that are on the Contributor checklist with a pass/fail check below. Please fix any issues that cause TravisCI to fail or ask for clarification--we try, but sometimes the errors can be unclear.
