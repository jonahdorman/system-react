# Design System for React
### Accessible, localization-friendly, presentational React components

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/salesforce/design-system-react.svg?token=erkizBStRxre5p3S1xij&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/salesforce/design-system-react) [![DeepScan Grade](https://deepscan.io/api/projects/1475/branches/4666/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard/#view=project&pid=1475&bid=4666)

## Getting Started
Welcome to the project! :wave: This library is the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) implementation of the [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). It has been tested with React >=15.4.1 <16 and is stable despite its version numbers. A 1.0 will be released soon.

* [Usage with Webpack](docs/webpack.md)

#### ECMAScript 6, CommonJS and `create-react-app`

It is highly recommended that you `npm install` the `-es` suffixed tag and import individual components. You will need a [stage-1 and higher proposed features](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1/) transpiler ([stage-1 Babel preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-stage-1) or review our `.babelrc`) and include transpiling the `node_modules/design-system-react` folder in your configuration. The non-suffixed package is a [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html) build that should allow dropping dead code, but not tree-shaking.

_`create-react-app` and any environment that does not transpile or let you transpile ES6 code within the `node_modules` folder is not compatible with the `-es` suffixed tag. Please use the non-suffixed CommonJS tag until an NPM module is published that is compatible with `create-react-app`._

### Local development Storybook and in-browser test server

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:9001 http://localhost:8001
```
### SLDS Icons

Prior to v0.7.0, SLDS icons were bundled with the JavaScript. The 400KB+ icons bundle from [SLDS](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) is no longer included. You will need to download the SLDS CSS and icons separately.

#### Serve icons publically

Typically, scripts should be downloaded in the background without blocking the DOM. With React, this works best with [server side rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertostaticmarkup). SLDS recommends placeholder stencils while scripts are initializing if the HTML cannot be served immediately. If you can serve the HTML, then icon SVGs should not be bundled and served like any other file. Set a path `context` for all child components with `<IconSettings>` at the top of your render tree:

```
import IconSettings from 'design-system-react/components/icon-settings';

ReactDOM.render(
	<IconSettings iconPath="/assets/icons">
		<MyApp />
	</IconSettings>,
	document.getElementById('app')
	)

// `/assets/icons` wil be prepended to `/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg#account` within the SVG path
<svg aria-hidden="true" class="slds-icon">
   <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="/assets/icons/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg#account"></use>
</svg>
```

#### Bundle icons

If you use a module bundler, like Webpack, you can import the individual `sprite` files and assign them to the `<IconSettings>` sprite properties. Your SVG images will be bundled with your scripts and block the DOM from rendering until the script file is loaded.

```
import IconSettings from 'design-system-react/components/icon-settings';

import standardSprite from '@salesforce-ux/design-system/assets/icons/standard-sprite/svg/symbols.svg';
...
...

ReactDOM.render(
	<IconSettings standardSprite={standardSprite}>
		<MyApp />
	</IconSettings>,
	document.getElementById('app')
	)
```

### Example

Add the following line to your `package.json` devDependencies and run `npm install`.

```
# package.json

"design-system-react": "git+ssh://git@github.com:salesforce/design-system-react.git#v[VERSION]",
```

The bundled files are provided only for convenience.

* `design-system-react.min.js` (700KB+) - includes icons in the JavaScript
* `design-system-react-components.min.js` (~400KB) - no icons.

Import and use only the components you need:

```
import Tooltip from 'design-system-react/components/popover-tooltip';
import Icon from 'design-system-react/components/icon';
import IconSettings from 'design-system-react/components/icon-settings';

<IconSettings iconPath="/assets/icons">
  <Tooltip
    align="top"
    content={<span>Here is more information.</span>}
  >
    <a href="javascript:void(0)">
      <Icon assistiveText="More Info" category="utility" name="info" className="slds-icon-text-default" />
    </a>
  </Tooltip>
</IconSettings>
```

## Contributing to the code base

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Test README](/tests/README.md) first. Then, create an issue to tell others you are working on a bug. If you would like to contribute a new component, create an issue with a list of proposed props to discuss with maintainers. Issues not addressed with pull requests may be closed eventually.
