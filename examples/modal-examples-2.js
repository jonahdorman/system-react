							<p>"He's always saying that," he said to Edwin. "What is scarlet?"</p>
							<p>"'The scarlet of the maples can shake me like the cry of bugles going	by,'" the old man quoted.</p>
							<p>"It's red," Edwin answered the question. "And you don't know it because	you come from the Chauffeur Tribe. They never did know nothing, none of	them. Scarlet is red&mdash;I know that."</p>
							<p>"Red is red, ain't it?" Hare-Lip grumbled. "Then what's the good of	gettin' cocky and calling it scarlet?"</p>
							<p>"Granser, what for do you always say so much what nobody knows?" he	asked. "Scarlet ain't anything, but red is red. Why don't you say red,	then?"</p>
							<p>"Red is not the right word," was the reply. "The plague was scarlet.	The whole face and body turned scarlet in an hour's time. Don't I	know? Didn't I see enough of it? And I am telling you it was scarlet	because&mdash;well, because it was scarlet. There is no other word for it."</p>
							<p>"Red is good enough for me," Hare-Lip muttered obstinately. "My dad	calls red red, and he ought to know. He says everybody died of the Red	Death."</p>
							<p>"Your dad is a common fellow, descended from a common fellow," Granser	retorted heatedly. "Don't I know the beginnings of the Chauffeurs? Your	grandsire was a chauffeur, a servant, and without education. He worked	for other persons. But your grandmother was of good stock, only the	children did not take after her. Don't I remember when I first met them,	catching fish at Lake Temescal?"</p>
							<p>"What is education?" Edwin asked.</p>
