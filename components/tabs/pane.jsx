// # Tabs: Pane child component
//
// Helps implement the [Tabs design pattern](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/tabs/) in React.
//
// The `<Pane />` component allows us to simplify the structure of the `<Tabs />` component.
//
// Rather than require different (deeply nested) children for tabslist, with its tab(s) as well as tabpanel(s), we provide this Pane component which takes a `label` property that will become what is shown on the `<Tab />` that will be associated with it.
//
// The `children` of the Pane will be fed to the `<TabPanel />` component, while its `label` is handled in `<Tab />`, via `<TabsList />`.
/**
 *
 * ```
 * <Pane label="Tab 1">
 * 	<div>
 * 		<h2 className="slds-text-heading--medium">This is my tab 1 contents!</h2>
 * 		<p>They show when you click the first tab.</p>
 * 	</div>
 * </Pane>
 * ```
