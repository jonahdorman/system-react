Thank you for taking the time to file an issue.

* For bugs, please provide instructions on duplicating the bug. Code to paste into the editable documentation site examples would be helpful.
* Please create an issue to allow maintainers to determine if the feature is in the project's scope--which is implementing SLDS with React. See code overview file for more details on scope.
* Please comment in the issue if you plan to work on a fix. Feature and new component requests will likely be closed within 30 days if no one offers to work on the issue.
* Props and file location are the only breaking changes in this library. If you plan to work on a new component, please propose a props list after looking at newly written components and the codebase overview document.
* You can expect an initial response from a maintainer typically within 7 days. This is a very distributed, inner-sourced project, even within Salesforce, but if you havenâ€™t heard anything by then, feel free to ping or bump the thread, and it won't be considered rude.
